# termux-debian
A script to install a Debian chroot into Termux

`apt update && apt install wget -y && /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/wget https://github.com/comp500/termux-debian/raw/master/termux-debian.sh && sh termux-debian.sh`

Doesn't work for me as debian image is 64-bit, while my phone is 32-bit.
